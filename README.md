# Bouncing Balls
This project follows the tutorial located at [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_building_practice).

In this article we will write a classic "bouncing balls" demo, to show you how useful objects can be in JavaScript. Our little balls will bounce around on the screen, and change color when they touch each other.
